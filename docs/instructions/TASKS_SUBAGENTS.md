## Context window, tasks, and subagents

Use tasks whenever there's more than a couple of things to keep track of.

Use subagents where appropriate:
- e.g. for running a battery of tests, checking lint/build, curl, Puppeteer/Playwright or other browser automation, other verbose output, Git commits, any other verbose-output, and anywhere else where you think it's a good fit
- They are especially valuable as a way to avoid filling up your context window
- They are also a good fit for encapsulated & well-defined tasks, i.e. tasks that don't need the full context of the conversation so far, and/or where we only need a summary of what was done in order to proceed
- Use subagents in parallel where possible (because this is faster), but only if there isn't a dependency between tasks (e.g. the output of this one is useful as input for the next)
- Give them lots of background so that they can make good decisions, e.g. about goals, point them to relevant docs/code, what we've been changing, gotchas & things to avoid, relevant environment variables like $PORT for Puppeteer/Playwright, using Jest for testing, the current date/time from `date`, and anything else that will help them to be effective but correct/careful.
- Tell subagents what to be cautious of, and to abort and provide feedback on what happened if there are problems or surprises (to avoid them going rogue and doing more harm than good)
- Remind them to use Playwright in headless & isolated mode.
