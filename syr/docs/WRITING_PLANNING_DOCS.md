# Project Management Practices

see also: `docs/WRITING_EVERGREEN_DOCS.md`

This is a guide for writing planning/project management `.md` files, e.g. `planning/yyMMdd_complex_project.md`. These are for thinking through & documenting decisions, breaking down complex projects into multiple stages, and tracking progress.

Aim to keep these concise, and only include stuff explicitly agreed with the user.

If you're starting the doc from scratch, store it in `planning/`, and first ask the user questions about their project requirements to clarify key decisions. (Use MCP or run `date +"%y%m%d"` command first to get the current date for naming the file)

Update this doc regularly to keep the actions up-to-date. When you change it, make minimal, focused changes, based on new user input.


## Document structure

### Goal, context

- Clear problem/goal statement(s) at top, plus enough context/background to pick up where we left off
- If the goal is complex, break things down in detail about the desired behaviour.

### Principles, key decisions

- Include any specific principles/approaches or decisions that have been explicitly agreed with the user (over and above existing Cursor rules, project examples, best practices, etc).
- As you get new information from the user, update this doc so it's always up-to-date.


### Actions

- Break into lots of stages. Start with a really simple working v1, and gradually layer in complexity, ending each stage with passing tests and working code.
- List action in the order that they should be tackled
- Don't number the stages, so that it's easier to move them around without having to renumber everything
- Label the beginning of each action section with TODO, DONE, etc, updating task status as we go along
- Include subtasks with clear acceptance criteria
- Referring concretely to specific files/functions, so it's clear exactly what needs to be done
- Explicitly add tasks for writing automated tests, usually before writing code. (Perhaps one or two end-to-end tests first, then gradually adding more detailed tests as complexity grows). Explicitly add tasks for running the automated tests before ending each stage. see `docs/FRONTEND_TESTING.md`
- If there are actions that the user needs to do, add those in too, so we can track progress and remind the user.
- Ask the user whether we should have an early action to create a `yyMMdd_complex_project` Git branch (and move over any changes), and a final action to merge that back into `main`.


Example action:

- [ ] This is a top-level action description line
  - [ ] It can have sub-points that get ticked off
  - [x] This one has already been finished
